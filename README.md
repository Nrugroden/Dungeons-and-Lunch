# _**Dungeons & Lunch 0.1e**_
 
## _**Principles of Lunch:**_
* _**Lunch must always remain an enjoyable experience.**_
* _**The rules of the lunch must remain absurd and completely esoteric.**_


## _**How to Play:**_
 
_&emsp;The lunch goers gather together and each roll a d20 to determine who is the Lunch Lady for the day. The lunch goer who rolled the lowest is the Lunch Lady. Should a tie occur, the tying lunch goers will continue to roll d4’s until one of them is the lowest roller. Once a Lunch Lady is decided, they may choose to replace the Temporal Restaurant with the restaurant they own (**THIS NEEDS MORE RULES**). Now the Lunch Lady will roll a d20 to determine where the group will travel for lunch._

### _**Laws of Lunch Lady Land:**_

* _If a Lunch Lady should crit fail their first d20 roll, they must buy lunch for the group that day._
* _If the next roll is a crit fail, the next roll is rolled against the Tier 1 restaurants. The Lunch Lady is granted the title The Rose (Only if they actually end up buying lunch for the group)_
* _If the next roll is a crit, the Lunch Lady invokes Cheating Death
The Lunch Lady then rolls as normal to decide where the group goes._
* _If a Lunch Lady should crit their first roll, they will roll the d20 again, this time against the Tier 1 list of restaurants. If on the next roll, the Lunch Lady should crit, the group invokes Gone Fishin’_
* _After the group has returned from lunch, the Lunch Lady shall roll a d20 to decide what restaurant is swapped from the Lunch Pool into Tier 0._

### _**Solo Roller:**_

* _Doing this grants you the title The Single Served_
* _The lunch goer heading to lunch alone must take a selfie with their lunch, and post it to some channel for the non lunch goers to view._
	
### _**Candy Land**_
* _Once a restaurant is decided, the group should check to see if that roll is in the Desert Roll list. If the restaurant roll is in the Desert Roll list, the group grabs desert at that restaurant, or Flapdoodles. Then wipe the list._
* _After the group returns from lunch, the Lunch Lady rolls a d20 to add a number to the Desert Roll list_

### _**Rights of the People:**_

* _Once a restaurant has been selected, a lunch goer may choose to spend a Veto Point (FIGURE OUT THE RULES AROUND THIS), forcing the Lunch Lady to reroll._
* _If a Veto Point has been spent and Late to Lunch is invoked, then should the new lunch goer become the Lunch Lady, the lunch goer who spent their Veto Point gets it back._


## _**The Rules:**_
	
_**A Beaver Dam:**_
* _Should Wade ever decide he wants to go to lunch, the group must abandon all lunch plans and Wade is made the Lunch Lady and must roll. Should he try to bail, the group must invoke Tear Down That Wall._

_**Cheating Death:**_
* _When a Lunch Lady crit fails, then crits, the group must split the cost of the Lunch Lady’s meal, and the Lunch Lady now rolls against the Tier 1 restaurants. The Lunch Lady is also granted the title The Reaper._

_**Fall From Grace:**_
* _The Rule for when a Lunch Lady crits, then crit fails (WHAT HAPPENS GAMEPLAY WISE). The Lunch Lady is granted the title of  Lord Of Flames._

_**Gone Fishin’:**_
* _When rolling a d20 against a restaurant, should the Lunch Lady roll 2 consecutive crits, the  group calls Tim and everyone takes the rest of the day off and hangs out with Tim and his boat._
    * _The Lunch Lady is also granted the title The Admiral._
    * _If Gone Fishin’ was rolled after a crit fail, the Lunch Lady is granted the title The Rear Admiral_
* _If there is a counter on the Tim of our Lives Chart, the group can roll to invoke Gone Fishin’ once a week. To successfully invoke Gone Fishin’ this way (**THIS NEEDS TO BE FIGURED OUT**)_

_**Gone Hibernatin’:**_
* _Should a Lunch Lady roll invoke Gone Fishin’ in a non-boating season, the group adds a counter to the Tim of our Lives Chart (**NOT SURE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE OR IS ACTUALLY CALLED**) for later use. The Lunch Lady then starts to roll for lunch again from scratch._

_**Hammer Time:**_
* _The lunch goer with the most consecutive lunches is granted the title The Hammer._

_**Indecision Rule:**_
* _If, after consulting the rules, The group is still unsure of how to proceed, the group will start the ritual over. And don’t fuck it up this time._

_**Late to Lunch:**_
* _Should a lunch goer decide to join after a restaurant has been selected, the new lunch goer must roll initiative against the Lunch Lady. Should the new lunch goer lose the roll, they become the Lunch Lady and roll against the current Tier of restaurants. Should the current Lunch Lady lose, the restaurant choice stands. The lunch goer that invokes this rule is granted the title The Sloth_
* _A lunch goer who is Late to Lunch does not get their meal paid for by a previous Lunch Lady, but can roll such that they must pay for everyones lunch_

_**The Lemon:**_
* _Upon leaving a restaurant, if the group agrees it was bad, it is stricken from the lists, until such a time as a lunch goer is able to enter it back into the lunch pool._

_**Oreo Rule:**_
* _If the group ends up going to the same restaurant more than once in a week, the subsequent visits require a desert roll._

_**Resupply:**_
* _If the group makes a Costco run without having gone there for lunch, the group going must get ice cream._

_**Roll Call:**_
* _When a roller calls out their roll correctly, they are granted the title The Caller of Rolls._

_**Tea Party:**_
* _(**ASK NICK WHAT THIS WAS**) This person is granted the title The Freedom Fighter._

_**Tear Down That Wall:**_
* _Should Wade attempt to back out of a Beaver Dam, the group must peer pressure him into playing this game with the same vigor of a group of highschool junior football players trying to get the new kid on the team to drink a beer. Who ever succeeds in convincing Wade to play along is granted the title Mr.Reagan._

_**Wandering Wednesday:**_
* _On wednesday the roller rolls a d4  to see what quadrant of rochester we wander to. The roller then gets to select a restaurant from that quadrant._
