# _**Dungeons & Lunch 2e**_
 
## _**Principles of Lunch:**_
* _**Lunch must always remain an enjoyable experience.**_
* _**The rules of the lunch must remain absurd and completely esoteric.**_
* _**The Dice be praised!**_


## _**How to Play:**_
_&emsp;The lunch goers gather together and each roll a d20 to determine who is the Lunch Lady for the day. The lunch goer who rolled the lowest initiative is the Lunch Lady. Should a tie occur, the tying lunch goers will continue to roll d20’s until one of them has a lower roll. Once a Lunch Lady is chosen, they may choose to replace the Temporal Restaurant with the restaurant they own (**THIS NEEDS TO BE IMPLIMENTED**). Now the Lunch Lady will go to roll a d20 to determine where the group will travel for lunch._

### _**Laws of Lunch Lady Land:**_
* _If a Lunch Lady should crit fail their first d20 roll, they must buy lunch for the group that day._
    * _If the next roll is a crit fail, the group must go to Denny's_
    * _If the next roll is a crit, the Lunch Lady invokes [Cheating Death](#cheating-death). The Lunch Lady then rolls as normal to decide where the group goes._
* _If a Lunch Lady should crit their first roll, they will roll the d20 again, this time against the Tier 1 list of restaurants. If on the next roll, the Lunch Lady should crit, the group invokes [Gone Fishin’](#gone-fishin)_
* _Now the Lunch Lady goes to [Candy Land](#candy-land)._
* _After the group has returned from lunch, the Lunch Lady shall roll a d20 to decide what restaurant is swapped from the Lunch Pool into Tier 0._
    * _At least one member of the group had to go to the chosen restaurant to actually swap that restaurant out._

### _**Solo Roller:**_
* _This only applies if a lunch goer goes to lunch alone. All effects of this rule set are nullified if [Late to Lunch](#late-to-lunch) is invoked._
* _Doing this grants you the title The Single Served._
* _A Solo Roller does not visit [Candy Land](#candy-land)._
* _The lunch goer heading to lunch alone must take a selfie with their lunch and post it to some channel for the non lunch goers to view._
	
### _**Candy Land**_
* _Once a restaurant is decided, the group should check to see if that roll is in the Desert Roll list._
    * _If the restaurant roll is in the Desert Roll list, the group grabs desert at that restaurant, or Flapdoodles. Then wipe the list._
    * _If it is not, add it to the Desert Roll list._

### _**Rights of the People:**_
* _Once a restaurant has been selected, a lunch goer may choose to spend a Veto Point (FIGURE OUT THE RULES AROUND THIS), forcing the Lunch Lady to reroll._
    * _If a Veto Point has been spent and [Late to Lunch](#late-to-lunch) is invoked, then should the new lunch goer become the Lunch Lady, the lunch goer who spent their Veto Point gets it back._
* _If the group can agree that no one wants to go to the selected restaurant, the group invokes [Two For One Special](#two-for-one-special)._

#### _**Gone Hibernatin’:**_
* _Should a Lunch Lady roll invoke Gone Fishin’ in a non-boating season, the group adds a counter to the Tim of our Lives Chart (**NOT SURE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE OR IS ACTUALLY CALLED**) for later use. The Lunch Lady then starts to roll for lunch again from scratch._

#### _**Hammer Time:**_
